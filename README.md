## üéâ Acknowledgements

 - Wulen Happy Hour was was born out of a realization - the scarcity of easily accessible information about the myriad of bars and venues offering enticing deals. In bustling cities, countless establishments hide remarkable deals and captivating experiences, waiting to be discovered.

- This app aims to bridge that gap by leveraging technology to provide a comprehensive platform for users to effortlessly explore nearby bars, uncover their exclusive deals, and enjoy their favorite happy hours in the city.
